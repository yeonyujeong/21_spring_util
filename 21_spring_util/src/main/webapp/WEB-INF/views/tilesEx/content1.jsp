	 <h2>Bridge Over Troubled Water - simon and garfunkel </h2>
	 <p>When you're weary
		Feeling small
		When tears are in your eyes
		I'll dry them all
		I'm on your side
		Oh, when times get rough
		And friends just can't be found
		Like a bridge over troubled water
		I will lay me down
		Like a bridge over troubled water
		I will lay me down
		When you're down and out
		When you're on the street
		When evening falls so hard
		I will comfort you
		I'll take your part
		Oh, when darkness comes
		And pain is all around</p>
</body>
