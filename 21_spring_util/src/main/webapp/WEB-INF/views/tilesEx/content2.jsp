	<h2>Wonderful Tonight - Eric Clapton</h2>
	<p>
		It's late in the evening
		She's wondering what clothes to wear
		She puts on her make up
		And brushes her long blonde hair
		And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
		And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
		We go to a party
		And everyone turns to see
		This beautiful lady
		That's walking around with me
		And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
		And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
