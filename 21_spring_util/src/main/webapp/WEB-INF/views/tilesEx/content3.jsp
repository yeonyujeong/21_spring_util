	<h2>Evergreen - Susan Jacks</h2>
	<p>
		Sometimes love will bloom
		in the spring time
		Then my flowers in summer
		it will grow
		Then fade away in the winter
		When the cold wind
		begins to blow


		But when it's
		evergreen, evergreen
		It will last through the summer
		and winter too
		When love is
		evergreen, evergreen
		Like my love for you
	</p>
